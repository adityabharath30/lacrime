Data Story Analysis of Crime in Los Angeles
As a student at UCLA, I've observed on numerous counts that the city of Los Angeles is not what one would call "safe". Between the homelessness, drug addiction, and cost of living, something is contributing to the crime rate rising year on year. The violent crime rate in Los Angeles is almost 1.5x that of New York City. Source: https://realestate.usnews.com/places/california/los-angeles/crime

With this in mind, I wanted to explore the various aspects to crime and arrests in Los Angeles. The Key research questions I tackled include:
1. What is the demographic profile of the victims and arrested suspects of the crime?
2. Is there migration between the site of crime and the location of arrests?
3. What is the time trend of crimes committed? Do arrests follow a similar trend or does it lag?
4. Which are the most unsafe neighbourhoods in Los Angeles?
